## General Information
- Company: BoomBikes (US bike sharing provider)
- Business Challenge: The company recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
- Data: The client has provided historical data of the duration 2018 to 2019
- Client's Expectation: Share variables which are significant in predicting the demand and provide the model which can be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- the predictors are concluded which are significatly impacting on the demands and the model is finalized for the demand prediction. Details are documented in the pdf file (Rujuta_SharedBike-Linear_Regression_Assignment.pdf)

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.5 (64 bits)
- Jupiter Notebook - version 6.4.8
- Git - version 2.37.3.windows.1
- GitHub version 2.37.3
